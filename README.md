# Welcome to Magi

Welcome to the Magi wiki. Here you will find documentation related to the University of Sorbonne Paris North research support department. Letâ€™s start our journey with the presentation of HPC resources. In an HPC cluster all resources are gathered in
different partitions. A partition is a set of homogeneous compute nodes (ie computers that run your code). Here are the resources available on Magi for HPC part:

| Partition name | Number of nodes | Processor | GPU | Memory | Network |
| -- | -- | -- | -- | -- | -- |
| COMPUTE | 51 | 2 x Intel(R) Xeon(R) CPU E5-2650 v3 @ 2.30GHz (40 cores) | x | 64 GB | Infiniband |
| MISC-56c | 15 | 2 x Intel(R) Xeon(R) Gold 5120 CPU @ 2.20GHz (56 cores) | x | 96 GB | Ethernet 1 GB |
| SMP-80c | 1 | 2 x Intel(R) Xeon(R) CPU E7-4820 v3 @ 1.90GHz (80 cores) | x | 512 GB | Ethernet 1 GB |
| SMP-128c | 2 | 2 x AMD EPYC 7502 32-Core Processor (128 cores) | x | 256 GB | Ethernet 1 GB |
| SMP-256c | 2 | 2 x AMD EPYC 9554 64-Core Processor (256 cores) | x | 1,6 TB | Ethernet 1 GB |
| GPU-A100 | 1 | 2 x AMD EPYC 7513 32-Core Processor (128 cores) | 10 x NVIDIA A100 80 GB  | 512 GB | Ethernet 1 GB |
| FORMATION | 2 | 2 x Intel(R) Xeon(R) Bronze 3204 CPU @ 1.90GHz (6 cores) | x | 48 GB | Ethernet 1 GB |

We have three flavors of each partition:
* Regular means that your job can run forever;
* Short means that your job can run for 3 days, but you get an higher priority than Regular;
* Very short means that your job can run for 3 hours, but you get an higher priority than Short.

To invoke a partition flavor you will use the partition name for regular (eg COMPUTE), the partition name with the suffix SHORT for short (eg COMPUTE-SHORT) and the partition name with the suffix VERYSHORT for very short (eg COMPUTE-VERYSHORT).

## SLURM quickstart howto

We use SLURM (Simple Linux Utility for Resource Management) as the job scheduler for our HPC cluster. In this section, we will introduce SLURM basic commands.
